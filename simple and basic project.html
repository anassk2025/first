        <h1>Avengers the end game</h1>
        <p>Introduction and Setting
Avengers: Endgame is a superhero film directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, and produced by Marvel Studios. It is the direct sequel to Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and the culmination of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) storylines developed over 22 films. The film deals with the aftermath of Thanos’ (Josh Brolin) devastating snap, which wiped out half of all life in the universe.

The Aftermath of the Snap
The film begins with the immediate aftermath of the snap, showing the impact on the remaining Avengers and the world at large. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Nebula (Karen Gillan) are stranded in space but are rescued by Captain Marvel (Brie Larson). They return to Earth and regroup with the remaining Avengers: Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and James Rhodes (Don Cheadle).

The Plan to Reverse the Snap
The Avengers locate Thanos, who has destroyed the Infinity Stones to prevent further use. Thor beheads Thanos in a fit of rage. Five years later, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) escapes from the quantum realm and proposes a plan to travel back in time to collect the Infinity Stones before Thanos can use them.

Time Heist
The Avengers split into teams to retrieve the stones from different points in time:

New York, 2012: Tony, Steve, Bruce, and Scott retrieve the Mind, Space, and Time Stones.
Asgard, 2013: Thor and Rocket (Bradley Cooper) retrieve the Reality Stone.
Morag and Vormir, 2014: Nebula and Rhodey retrieve the Power Stone, while Natasha and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) retrieve the Soul Stone. Natasha sacrifices herself so Clint can obtain the Soul Stone.
The Final Battle
With the stones collected, Bruce uses them to reverse the snap. However, Thanos from 2014 learns of their plan and travels to the present. A massive battle ensues between Thanos’ forces and the Avengers, who are joined by the revived heroes and their allies. Tony ultimately sacrifices himself by using the stones to disintegrate Thanos and his army, saving the universe but dying in the process.

The Aftermath and Legacy
The film concludes with Tonys funeral, attended by all the major characters. Thor appoints Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) as the new ruler of New Asgard and joins the Guardians of the Galaxy. Steve returns the stones to their original timelines and chooses to stay in the past to live a full life with Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell). An elderly Steve passes his shield to Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), naming him the new Captain America.
